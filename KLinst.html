    <ul>
      <li>Clicking in the text box above makes an on-screen keyboard appear. &nbsp;The little box beside it lets you choose between English and Klallam.</li>
      <li>To choose Klallam you would choose the pulldown item 'clm - KlallamU', or to enter in English (default), choose English.</li>
      <li>Enter the word you wish to search for. &nbsp;It can be either in English (such as 'salmon'), or Klallam (such as 'kʷítšən'), or a category (such as 'Fish').</li>
      <li>Click on the 'Submit' button. &nbsp;If your word was found, a listing will appear in this window. &nbsp;If not, the whole 3500+ words will appear!</li>
    </ul>
<p style="color:coral">This lookup table comes from several sources: Klallam Word Of The Day - WOTD, Klallam Dictionary - KD, literature such as Lambert's 'The 7 Brothers of the House of Ste-Tee-Thlum', Tim Montler's http://klallam.montler.net, and other sources as I find them. &nbsp;As of 7/24/18 there are about 3500 entries.</p>
